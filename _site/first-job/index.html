  <h1>First job/internship</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>We all have been there, we all have been through it, and you will too 💪. We all, as humans beings, will need to conquer the very first job/internship from our lives. We might have different personal motives to accomplish this personal milestone. Moreover the end of this goal may shift from one another. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You might need this job to validate yourself to someone. That someone could be your parent, someone you love or yourself 💕</li>
  <li>You could be in need for a job for your own survival.</li>
  <li>You can have the passion for doing that job.</li>
  <li>You may want to help other by doing so.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="arming-up-for-the-battle-">Arming up for the battle 🛠</h2>

<p>Having stated some examples of job motivation, now you need to root for it. You have to apply for that job and present yourself. You will have to define yourself and state your strengths, trust me we all have them. If you don’t see them yourself ask anyone in your social circle 😀</p>

<p>The best way to prepare yourself for this moment is to be able to answer the following question: Why? Why do you want or need to have that job. Is it because what the job achieves is align with who you are? Or is it because you want to learn how to do that job?</p>

<p>Could also be the rewards from the job which are appealing to you. The rewards can be economic 💰, moral, new experiences and a whole lot of other reasons. The main point here is that you have to stand your ground if someone ask you why you are working there. You have to be contented and relieved if someone asks you about what you do for a living.</p>

<p>Now that the reason is crystal clear, you will need to study which projects or tasks does that job implies. Research 📚 how is the recent history of that specific job and who you will be working with. Its better if you have an idea of who you will be working with and what tasks you will be in charge of.</p>

<p>You will face tough questions and mostly blunt assumptions about yourself. The best way to surpass this might be to expose your vulnerabilities 🎯. We trust people who fail, who feels approachable, who isn’t afraid to show themselves as they truly are.</p>

<p>All humans make mistakes, if they expect a perfect employee wish them luck hiring a robot 🤖. We as humans do not trust people who seem flawless, we don’t empathize with people who are idealized.</p>

<p>You will succeed on your first try for that job application 🙌 or you will learn some valuable experience 😎. Bear in mind you have to enjoy life journey, there will be ups and there will be downs. Although we have to always learn from our experiences 🙂</p>

<h2 id="now-what-">Now what? 😅</h2>

<p>Congratulations! 🎉 You made it 🏁</p>

<p>But wait… Now you will have even more questions that you had before 😅</p>

<p>After being relieved from the main question you had before: will they choose me? Overcoming that relieve you will face now lots of questions❓ about your new journey.</p>

<p>We can imagine the most important one: will I be able to do it? will I be able to keep up the expectations?</p>

<p>In the previous section I wrote about vulnerability and failure so lets dive more into this. Lets talk about some feeling you might be having as you begin doing that job. We will get to know better a syndrome which you might have felt before. Because you are not the only one, and furthermore you will not be the last one by far.</p>
